Programming Challenges (COMP4128); 6 Units of Credit – Term 2 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: How do competitive programmers solve complex problems in a matter of minutes? In this course, you will design and implement advanced algorithms to solve problems accurately and quickly. You will discover sophisticated applications of dynamic programming, data structures, graph algorithms, mathematics and more. Most importantly, you will learn to deconstruct a problem in order to evaluate which algorithm design techniques are appropriate, combining ideas from different contexts, and address the challenges that lie in both solving the problem conceptually and producing a C/C++ program which enacts your solution. Can you rise to the challenge?
Aims: It is common for computing professionals to be faced with challenging problems that require both algorithmic thinking and skillful programming to solve. The aim of this course is to train students in the implementation of solutions of such problems, focusing on accuracy, efficiency and speed.
Learning approach: Moodle - Learning Management System | Echo 360 | Discourse forum, CMS
Attendance requirements: Students are strongly encouraged to attend all classes and review lecture recordings.

Course Details & Outcomes:
- CLO1: Apply the C++ programming language to solve programming problems (Assessed via: Problem Sets, Contests, Final Exam)
- CLO2: Adapt templated data structures and algorithms to meet the requirements of complex problems (Assessed via: Problem Sets, Contests, Final Exam)
- CLO3: Design and implement algorithmic solutions to complex problems, particularly under short time constraints (Assessed via: Problem Sets, Contests, Final Exam)
- CLO4: Apply algorithm design principles to evaluate programs in terms of correctness and running time (Assessed via: Problem Sets, Contests, Final Exam)

Assessments:
- Problem Sets (48%) – Due: End of exam period; Individual; Students attempt to solve a set of programming problems for each topic, and maintain a diary to reflect on the challenges they encountered. Submissions are automatically marked against a batch of test cases fitting the specifications provided to students. Students receive feedback of 'Accepted', 'Wrong Answer', 'Time Limit Exceeded', 'Runtime Error' and so on for each attempt, and have unlimited attempts at each problem to get the 'Accepted' verdict. Marks are awarded for the number of problems where the 'Accepted' verdict is received: each set consists of six problems, with (one/two/three/four) solved problem per set to achieve (PS/CR/DN/HD) and the final problems to distinguish top achievers. Students can get help from staff in person during lab time, by email or through the course forum. Students are expected to spend about eight hours per week on these problems.; There are no deadlines and no late penalties for the problem sets or problem diaries. However, trying to get through a large portion of the work at the end of term will invite stress and inhibit your ability to engage in classes. If you fall behind, we are happy to discuss a catch-up plan with you, which will usually entail prioritising the easiest problems of each set in the short term. Please email me (and cc your lab instructors) if you are concerned about falling behind.
- Contests (18%) – Due: Weeks 1, 5 and 9 (TBC); Individual; Students will participate in three programming contests during the term. The first is a long contest of duration two days, while the other two are short contests of duration three hours. These contests consist of programming problems from recent course material, with immediate feedback for each submission. Submissions are automatically marked against a batch of test cases fitting the specifications provided to students. Students receive feedback of 'Accepted', 'Wrong Answer', 'Time Limit Exceeded', 'Runtime Error' and so on for each attempt, and have unlimited attempts at each problem to get the 'Accepted' verdict. Marks are again awarded for the number of problems where the 'Accepted' verdict is received, including subtasks.; These contests are conducted remotely. Students are reminded that this is an individual assessment, and urged to conduct themselves with integrity. It is unfortunately difficult to schedule these assessments without clashes with your other classes, and without taking up too much of our already limited class time. I understand that weekends are not ideal for everyone, so if you are not able to participate during the scheduled times, please contact me and I will be happy to make alternative arrangements for you.
- Final Exam (34%) – Due: TBA during exam period; Individual; The final exam is held during the UNSW exam period and is a long contest (approximately 5 hours). This contest consists of programming problems on the entirety of course material, with immediate feedback for each submission. Submissions are automatically marked against a batch of test cases fitting the specifications provided to students. Students receive feedback of 'Accepted', 'Wrong Answer', 'Time Limit Exceeded', 'Runtime Error' and so on for each attempt, and have unlimited attempts at each problem to get the 'Accepted' verdict. Marks are again awarded for the number of problems where the 'Accepted' verdict is received, including subtasks.

Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (COMP4418); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: How can you timetable classes to fit everyone’s schedule? Could tactical voting occur in Australia? Can a single computer program play and solve both sudoku and minesweeper? Knowledge Representation and Reasoning is at the core of Artificial Intelligence and the corresponding course, COMP4418, will equip you to answer the questions above and many other ones, so-called combinatorial problems. To do so, I will teach you “modeling”, that is the representation of a problem and its solutions in a way the computer can understand. You will learn a declarative programming language, a paradigm in which one only specifies what constitutes a solution to a problem and then leaves it to the computer to actually find the solution. With this new tool under your belt, you can effectively tackle most combinatorial problems coming your way, from planning and scheduling to digital circuit synthesis or some limited program verification.
Aims: This course provides an introduction to the important approach to symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) known is Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). KRR has a long and distinguished history of research in AI with a broad range of approaches. In this course we concentrate on formal approaches to KRR, in particular logic based approaches – propositional logic, first-order logic, non-monotonic logic – and how they can be used to solve difficult computational problems. This course can be a starting point for further exploration of artificial intelligence. Further courses include COMP3431/COMP9431: Robotic Software Architecture, COMP9417: Machine Learning and Data Mining, COMP9444: Neural Networks and COMP9844: Extended Neural Networks.

Visual Analytics aims to facilitate the data analytics process through Information Visualisation. Information Visualisation aims to make good pictures of abstract information, such as stock prices, family trees, and software design diagrams. Well designed pictures can convey this information rapidly and effectively. The challenge for Visual Analytics is to design and implement effective Visualisation methods that produce pictorial representation of complex data so that data analysts from various fields (bioinformatics, social network, software visualisation and network) can visually inspect complex data and carry out critical decision making. This unit will provide basic HCI concepts, visualisation techniques and fundamental algorithms to achieve good visualisation of abstract information. Further, it will also provide opportunities for academic research and developing new methods for Visual Analytic methods.

Nowadays most client facing enterprise applications are running on web or at least with a web interface. The design and implementation of a web application require totally different set of skills to those are required for traditional desktop applications. All web applications are of client/ server architecture. Requests sent to a web application are expected to go through the public Internet, which slows the responsiveness and increases the possible security threat. A typical web application is also expected to handle large number of requests coming from every corner of the Internet and sent by all sorts of client systems. This further complicates the design of such system. This course aims at providing both conceptual understanding and hand-on experiences for the technologies used in building web applications. We will examine how data/messages are communicated between client and server; how to improve the responsiveness using rich client technology; as well as how to build a secure web application. At the end of this course, students are expected to have a clear understanding of the structure and technologies of web applications. Students are also expected to have practical knowledge of some major web application environments and to be able to develop and deploy simple web applications. Cloud based platform are increasingly popular as the development and deployment platform. This course will incorporate the cloud aspect of web application development as well.

Web Front-End Programming (COMP6080); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: COMP6080 aims to develop your confidence in building modern web-based applications to industry standards. This occurs through the introduction of a range of basic concepts surrounding HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Javascript Declarative Frameworks, UI/UX Principles, Accessibility, Network & Asynchronous Programming, Front-end Testing, and other basic infrastructure. This course has a heavy emphasis on industry voices, and as such a number of lectures will be given by current front-end developers from industry. These lectures primarily come from employees at Canva, a Sydney-based technology company that does a lot of work with front-end technologies. COMP6080 is a challenging course. Front-end development is unlike most things you've experienced at university before. You will find the individual problems you solve much simpler than other level 6 courses, but the time you will feel that you spend on the aggregate of these issues will feel larger. A number of students will find this course quite time consuming if they're hoping to achieve a high mark. We'd encourage you to reflect on this fact before you enrol in the course.
Aims: COMP6080 aims to develop your confidence in building modern web-based applications to industry standards. COMP6080 is a higher-level elective course and assumes that you have the following: A high level understanding of how interpreted scripting languages work (e.g. python), in terms of inputs, interpretation, loose typing, etc Ability to use GIT as a version management tool Basics of HTTP protocol and interacting with web browsers Postgraduate students may need to familiarise themselves with GIT, if not already familiar.

Assessments:
- Fortnightly coding exercises and quizzes (30%) – Due: Week 4; Individual; During labs, students will be given quizzes and/or small-scale coding exercises to complete as part of their assessment. These tasks will cover topics such as understanding compiler intermediate representation, graph representation of code, implementing basic graph traversal algorithms, using Z3 theorem prover for assertion verification, and abstract execution. These tasks will provide students with the opportunity to revisit and solidify individual concepts from the lectures. The quizzes and coding exercises will be marked based on the correctness of the student's implementation, and feedback will be provided to help students improve their coding skills, and understanding of the key knowledge in lectures.
- Static taint tracking (20%) – Individual; The objective of this assignment is to build a a tainted information flow tracker that integrates both the control-flow reachability analysis and data-dependence information. This enables the tracking of tainted input and the identification of tainted information flows on the code graph. The implementation of this assignment is a component of a course-generated automated source code analysis tool. The assignment requires students to enhance their coding and debugging skills by utilizing online slides and resources. These resources will also provide opportunities to learn how to write efficient and high-quality code checkers. As part of practicing the fundamental programming elements, the student is required to submit their implementation, which should compile correctly and produce the desired outputs. This assignment's implementation enhances the student's comprehension of source code analysis and code representation, serving as preparation for the development of a code analysis tool in future assessments.
- Abstract interpretation (25%) – Individual; The objective of this assignment is to practice and implement abstract interpretation. Students will have opportunities to build their abstract execution solvers and understand sound approximations of code semantics based on monotonic functions over lattices. They will work on fortnightly lab exercises as well as previous assignments to implement abstract interpretation/execution, which can be used to detect code defects. The objective is for students to grasp these fundamental concepts and apply them effectively. Successful completion of this assignment requires students to not only understand these concepts but also implement them accurately, ensuring that their programs compile without errors and generate the desired outputs.
- Assertion-based code verification (25%) – Individual; The objective of this assignment is to utilize symbolic execution and automated theorem prover to develop assertion-based verification, which automates the verification of code properties through the use of assertions. The assertion verification builds upon the fortnightly lab exercises as well as the control- and data-flow analysis implemented in Assignments 1. In this assignment, students are tasked with practicing the utilization of the satisfiability solver and applying it to automated assertion verification. By submitting accurate implementations that yield the desired outputs, students will successfully complete the final component of the automated code analyzer for the course. This component enables the analysis and verification of real-world programs."

Security Engineering and Cyber Security (COMP6441); 6 Units of Credit – Term 2 – Kensington – Delivery: Multimodal, Standard
Summary: In this introductory cybersecurity course we look at Security Engineering – the engineering principles behind designing, monitoring, and maintaining security in the face of an adversary. We explore selected case studies and examine the practical principles behind effective security. We introduce the fundamental ideas of security and then we look at how these are applied in current cyber security practice. We will pay particular attention to systems which fail and the importance of thinking like an attacker. This course involves analysis, critical thinking and design. A cunning and devious mind will be an asset. Although our main concern is cybersecurity, the engineering principles we cover apply to security more generally. This course introduces modern cybersecurity design and practice, and is suitable for anyone with a playful analytical mind and a general interest in security. We do not assume a programming background. We concentrate on analytical skills and the engineering approach to security design. We'll also bring you up to date with the current main trends in cybersecurity. In this course you will undertake an applied self directed security project. There is an associated ""Extended"" version of this course (COMP6841) for students who can code, ideally in C, and who know low level concepts such as memory implementation and function calling. CSE students will probably choose to take the extended version but are not required to. You can transfer between the courses before the census date if you can't make up your mind in advance which is better for you. The precise topics covered in this introductory course change somewhat from year to year to keep the coverage up-to-date and relevant. As you will see cybersecurity has recently been and remains a rapidly changing field. The field is now way too big for us to cover everything in detail in just one course but by the end of course you will have an overview of the major topics in contemporary security, a good understanding of the current state of play, and have begun to think like a security engineer. After completing either of these courses (COMP6441 or COMP6841) you can proceed to the other UNSW Computing Security Courses covering topics in: Digital forensics Penetration testing Memory corruption and exploitation Software assurance Incident response Malware analysis and reversing Cryptanalysis Cloud Security Professional issues and leadership in security Web application security Fun special projects Masterclass Our intention is to make this a highly enjoyable course. The field is quite stimulating as the security mindset you will develop involves understanding know how to break things in creative ways (as well as how to create things as is traditional in computing) with puzzles, cunning, cloak-and-dagger antics and a never-ending supply of amusing stories. However it will not be an easy course – you are expected to master the underlying theory *and* to be able to apply it to real world situations. There is a lot to learn and we expect you to work hard and study in your own time.

- Vulnerability Reports (30%) – Due: Week 7: 31 March - 06 April, Week 11: 28 April - 04 May; Group; This assessment allows students to showcase their learning throughout the course by providing a comprehensive portfolio of their in-term work, including vulnerabilities identified and exploits crafted. It will also allow students to demonstrate their communication skills as developed throughout the term. Students will be required to collaborate to present their work in the optimal light. In this assessment, students will culminate the vulnerabilities identified and exploited in the weekly activities and present them in the form of a vulnerability report. This reflects what is done in industry. As a group, they will present the vulnerabilities identified, exploits developed, consequences and impact of these exploits, defensive strategies and mitigation techniques. They are assessed on their communication, sophistication of exploit development, and overall presentation of content. Structure: Students are given a series of reports from industry and professional practice throughout the course and will use these as templates to develop their own reports addressing vulnerabilities found in the weekly challenges. This should be of similar quality to that found in the industry so that students can develop some experience in collaboration and communication relevant to related industry jobs before they graduate. Indicative workload: 40hours (20 hours per report) Feedback: Students receive feedback on their reports after each report, including before the census date. The final report mark is the sum of the two in-term marks.
- Final Exam (50%) – Due: Not Applicable; Individual; This is a competency-based 3 hour practical exam in which students will have the opportunity to demonstrate their identification and exploitation skills in various applications vulnerable to multiple classes of vulnerabilities. Indicative workload: 12 hours, including review study and practice. No exam feedback other than outcome.
- Weekly Activities (20%) – Due: Weekly submissions on Tuesdays; Individual; Weekly exercises to simulate real world vulnerability assessment and exploit development. These challenges are developed to be as close to vulnerabilities commonly found in the real world as possible. This is accompanied by a scoreboard to reflect an industry practice known as a Capture-The-Flag event. Structure: Each module over the term will accompany a new set of challenges reflecting the vulnerabilities discussed in lectures. Each challenge will involve a process of discovery, planning, exploitation, and immediate feedback on whether their exploits were effective. Indicative workload: 72 hours (8 hours per week, excluding quiet week) Feedback: Students receive feedback in the form of a point score with immediate results of exploitation for each vulnerability in the form of a flag."

System and Software Security Assessment (COMP6447); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: This course looks at cyber attack and defence. Students learn how to assess and identify vulnerabilities and how vulnerabilities are exploited. Students learn the principles and theory of exploitation, the common security models, and how approaches to exploitation and defence have evolved over time. Students from this course will engage in wargames, analyse real world case studies of vulnerabilities in complex software used on widespread systems, and gain an understanding of the technical process of finding and fixing low-level software vulnerabilities and also of the economics and causal factors involved with their real world use. The course covers techniques and skills including vulnerability classes, source code auditing,fuzzing, security bugs, software security assurance, taint analysis, memory corruption, overflows and return oriented programming. The course coverage will be constantly updated over time to reflect emerging attack and defence methods. There are numerous formative assessments and activities throughout the course to provide feedback and learning opportunities. Students need a keen, devious and analytical mind. To get the most from this course you will need to engage in independent study and act as a self-directed learner. Attending lectures alone will not be sufficient to pass the course. You will need to devote considerable practice to all the techniques we cover and read further on topics which interest you or which you do not fully understand. For a credit level result we expect you will spend 15 hours per week in total on this course. Seek feedback from your friendly lecturers, tutors and class peers constantly over the term and closely monitor yourself to make sure you are not falling behind. Experience has shown that students who do not work hard at the course do not do well, and often express disappointment later on at the missed opportunity.

Summary: COMP6771 is an advanced programming course teaching practical aspects of intermediate/advanced C++ programming. The course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of C++, followed by exploring powerful abstractions that C++ enables. This course focuses on using abstractions as well as building abstractions. COMP6771 is focused on modern, practical programming methods and tools. This course is designed for latter year CSE students with a reasonable degree of programming competencies. The course is heavily supported by Christopher Di Bella , a UNSW CSE graduate who is a well-regarded expert on C++. His knowledge and expertise assists in forming and updating the course. Our aim for students who complete this course satisfactorily is that they are highly competent in understanding C++ and it's core features, being able to build complex programs, data structures, and algorithms with C++, and being ready to immediately move into the workforce in areas that rely heavily on C++. Students will need to work consistently each week to maintain progress through the course.
Aims: This course aims to introduce the students to intermediate and advanced programming using C++. Students will be exposed to the core features of advance C++ with emphasis on how to incorporate them into well designed C++ programs. The first part of the course will introduce the basic features of C++, including references, functions, classes, C++ STL, operator overloading, and copy control. The second part will focus on more advanced topics such as exception handling, memory management, templates and generic programming, C++ template metaprogramming, input/output with C++ iostreams, C++ and efficiency issues, RTTI and effective C++ design guidelines. The structure, principles, and fundamental uses of the C++ Standard Library (including the Standard Template Library) will be introduced. The course will be useful to those who wish to get a strong understanding of practical aspects of C++.

A variety of programming concepts across many programming languages are examined, including: syntax, typing, polymorphism, documentation, testing, meta-programming, concurrency, parallelism, safety, and more. The Rust programming language is used as a reference language to teach considerations behind these concepts. As a language commonly cited to be well-considered, it serves as a good foundation to help students understand where countless other languages may let them down. Lectures will compare and contrast Rust with other languages, but will also discuss where Rust can similarly let students down. While proficiency in writing Rust programs is an important learning outcome of this course, of greater importance is the ability to write more robust programs in whichever language a student happens to be using at the time. Per the advice of previous students, COMP6991 is a difficult course with a considerable workload. Please reach out to us either on the course forum or the course email if you're not sure whether COMP6991 is right for you.

Principles of Programming (COMP9021); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: This course provides students with solid conceptual knowledge and practical skills of both generic programming techniques and Python programming, to be used effectively in the many specialised courses that expect students to have acquired strong enough programming skills and well mastered the Python language. The features of the language are covered to a significant depth, and there is a strong emphasis on problem solving, from a broad base of application domains, with quite a few that involve mathematical notions. Like all foundation courses for postgraduate students, there is a lot of contents to study in limited time and the learning curve is not gentle. Still the course does not assume any prior knowledge of programming in general, or of Python programming in particular, as its content is self-contained for students with the expected mathematical background.
Aims: The aim of the course is to provide students with a solid foundation on fundamental programming concepts and principles, and to become proficient in the programming language Python, including object-oriented features and the tkinter library to create widgets. Students will learn to design solutions to a broad range of problems and implement those solutions in the form of small to medium programs, using appropriate programming techniques and tools.

Programming Languages and Compilers (COMP9102); 6 Units of Credit – Term 1 – Kensington – Delivery: Multimodal, Standard
Summary: This subject focusses on basic compiler techniques needed to implement programming languages in a virtual machine (with emphasis on the compiler front end). By writing a compiler in Java to translate a variant of C into Java bytecode, you are also expected to gain a good understanding of important fundamental principles in object-oriented programming languages and develop further your programming and software engineering skills.
Aims: This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of building compilers. Through theory and practice, students will explore programming language structures using VC (a variant of C) and implement a compiler targeting JVM. By completing a term-long project consisting of five programming assignments, students will gain expertise in scanners, recognisers, parsers, semantic analysers, and code generators. The course emphasises learning about programming languages, compilers, and software development while improving project management skills.
Learning approach: Moodle - Learning Management System
Attendance requirements: Students are strongly encouraged to attend all classes and review lecture recordings.

Course Details & Outcomes:
- CLO1: Write a scanner, recogniser, parser, semantic analyser and code generator without the aid of automatic generators (Assessed via: Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Final Exam)
- CLO2: Understand how to specify the syntax and semantics of a programming language (Assessed via: Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Final Exam)
- CLO3: Specify and analyse the lexical, syntactic and semantic structures of advanced language features (Assessed via: Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Final Exam)
- CLO4: Design the data structures and support required for compiling advanced language features (Assessed via: Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
- CLO5: Gain proficiency in writing sizable object-oriented programs in Java, incorporating the use of packages, inheritance, dynamic dispatching, and the visitor design pattern (Assessed via: Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
- CLO6: Improve understanding of virtual machines, with a specific focus on the Java virtual machine (JVM) (Assessed via: Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)

Assessments:
- Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (50%) – Individual; The compiler project is marked out of 50 in the following proportions: Assignment 1, Value: 6/50 Assignment 2, Value: 6/50 Assignment 3, Value: 9/50 Assignment 4, Value: 15/50 Assignment 5, Value: 14/50 The average size of the completed compiler will be around 5,500 lines of code. Students will receive constructive feedback on their assignments, highlighting common mistakes that were made. All assignments are evaluated on correctness and the bulk of the marking is done by examining the output. We run your program through a large number of test cases and compare (diff) your output to the output of our solution. Your best bet is to thoroughly test your program on the provided test cases and make up others of your own until you feel confident in your solution. We will not spend a lot of time examining your source and/or giving design feedback. It is not that we do not consider style or design as being important, but by now all of you have taken a course like COMP2511/2911 and we hope you have internalised and practised good coding practices as a matter of habit. Thoughtful design and coding will improve your chances of having a correctly working program, too.
- Final Exam (50%) – Individual; There will be a two-hour closed-book written exam for this subject during the exam period. The exam will consist of mostly questions on the fundamental principles of the subject. For example, the topics that typically appear in the exam include regular expressions, NFA, DFA, context-free grammars, attribute grammars, LL parsing, and code generation. You will not be expected to remember all the details of the JVM instructions. A subset of JVM instructions that will be used in the exam will be provided."

Algorithmic Verification (COMP9153); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: This course replaces COMP4151, students can not receive credit for both. It is virtually impossible to guarantee the correctness of a system, and in turn the absence of bugs by standard software engineering practice such as code review, systematic testing and good software design alone. The formal methods community has developed various rigorous, mathematically sound techniques and tools that allow the automatic analysis of systems and software. The application of these fully automatic techniques is typically called algorithmic verification.The course will describe several automatic verification techniques, the algorithms they are based on, and the tools that support them. We will discuss examples to which the techniques have been applied, and provide experience with the use of several tools.
Aims: This course aims to introduce students to the theory and practice of Algorithmic Verification: the process of mathematically proving, using software tools, the correctness of programs and other computational systems. Building on knowledge from foundational mathematics courses, this course introduces students to the mathematical models and specification logics necessary to analyse the algorithms and verification tools used at the frontier of research in the area. Students will also be exposed to these tools on a practical level as they create their own formally verified system throughout the term.

Data Analytics for Graphs (COMP9312); 6 Units of Credit – Term 2 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: Graphs are ubiquitous and are widely used to capture relationships between different entities in real-world applications. However, compared with traditional sequential data (e.g. text and audio), the unstructured property and the sparsity make processing big graphs very challenging. The course will introduce a series of data structures and algorithms for graph processing in terms of database (i.e., big data) and deep learning. Fundamental methods and the state-of-the-art research works will be integrated. The course will serve as a launching pad for those interested in graph analytics, big data processing and graph neural networks. Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of many complex systems and software. Certain fundamental graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and depth-first search have been covered by many text books and compulsory courses. They may be discussed in terms of pseudocode and time complexity. This course will start from studying how to efficiently implement the fundamental algorithms in big graphs. Then, the course explores more challenging and more complex algorithms step-by-step. When dealing with big graphs, we may consider various scenarios such as external memory solutions, distributed solutions, multi-core solutions, etc. The course also puts some attention to graph neural networks, which is a hotspot in the area of AI and deep learning. The course will not study theoretical details about machine learning and deep learning but just introduce several representative graph neural networks. The students will play with basic graph learning tasks and understand learning-based techniques for graph problems such as link prediction and node classification.
Aims: The course aims to reinforce students' understanding of important graph algorithms and data structures, as well as building their capabilities in designing algorithms for big data processing. In particular, the course will improve students' ability to analyze time complexity, identify potential optimisations, and work on real problems. At the end of this course, you should be in a position where you could write efficient code to solve a complex graph problem. Some of you might even be at the stage where you could do research in the area of big graph processing and graph-based interdisciplinary problems.

Database Systems Implementation (COMP9315); 6 Units of Credit – Term 1 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: This course aims to introduce students to the detailed internal structure of database management systems (DBMSs) such as Oracle or SQL Server. DBMSs contain a variety of interesting data structures and algorithms that are also potentially useful outside the DBMS context; knowing about them is a useful way of extending your general programming background. While the focus is on relational DBMSs, given that they have the best-developed technological foundation, we will also consider more recent developments in the management of large data repositories. Relational DBMSs need to deal with a variety of issues: storage structures and management, implementation of relational operations, query optimisation, transactions, concurrency, recovery, security. The course will address most of these, along with a brief look at emerging database systems trends. The level of detail on individual topics will vary; some will be covered in significant detail, others will be covered relatively briefly. An important aspect of this course is to give you a chance to explore the internals of a real DBMS: PostgreSQL. Lectures will discuss the general principles of how DBMSs are implemented, and will also illustrate them with examples from PostgreSQL where possible. Since DBMSs are very large pieces of software, it won't be possible to explore the entire PostgreSQL system in depth.

Data Services Engineering (COMP9321); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: Online, Standard
Summary: This course aims to introduce the student to core concepts and practical skills for engineering the data in Web-service-oriented data-driven applications. Specifically, the course aims to expose students to basic infrastructure for building data services on the Web, including techniques to access and ingest data in internal/external sources, develop software services to curate (e.g. extract, transform, correct, aggregate the data), develop services to apply various analytics and develop services to visualize the data to communicate effectively using data. The course uses the Python programming language as the practical basis for its modules. However, the concepts taught are universal and can be applied to any other web development language/framework.
Aims: Software engineering has advanced rapidly in recent years. The knowledge-, service-, and cloud-based economy in parallel with the continuous improvement in connectivity, storage and data processing capabilities allow access to a data deluge from sensors, social-media, news, user-generated, government and private data sources. Accordingly, in a modern data-oriented landscape, data-driven applications may need to deal with a collection of datasets - from relational to NoSQL - that holds a vast amount of data gathered from various private/open data islands. Therefore, well-engineered service-oriented functionalities are critical for ingesting, organizing and querying the growing volume of data in data-driven application. This course aims to introduce the student to core concepts and practical skills for engineering the data in service-oriented data-driven applications. Specifically, the course aims to answer these questions: How to develop services to access and ingest data in internal/external sources of the data? How to develop services to use Databases (from Relational to NoSQL) as a Service for persisting user information? How to develop services to Curate (e.g. Extract, Transform, Correct, Aggregate, and Merge/Split) the data? How to develop services to apply analytics (e.g. by leveraging Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques) to the curated data? How to develop services to visualize the data to communicate effectively with data.

Capacity Planning of Computer Systems and Networks (COMP9334); 6 Units of Credit – Term 1 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: We live in a world that events do not happen instantly. It takes a certain amount of time to download a video from a server to your own mobile device. It takes a certain amount of time for a computer to finish the execution of an algorithm. The time to completion (or response time in performance analysis terminology) is a performance metric that computer scientists and computer engineers should be concerned about because no one wants to wait unnecessarily. If you can understand the factors that determine the response time, then you can influence those factors so that the response time becomes acceptable. This course will take a mathematical modelling and analytical approach to understand response time in computer systems and networks. The primary goal is to explore how mathematical modelling and mathematical methods can be used to model, analyse and design computer systems and networks so that they have good performance. There are three major topics that will be covered by this course: Queuing analysis (Note: Queues are important because they give rise to waiting time.) Discrete event simulation Integer programming for network design
Aims: The time response of computer systems and networks is an important attribute of their performance measure. Students will learn about mathematical modelling and analysis of response time in computer systems and networks. These topics will be covered Modelling computer systems and networks to understand response time Analytical methods to determine response time Discrete event simulation Integer programming for network design This is an elective course in the Networks majors in both undergraduate and postgraduate programs.

Computer Vision (COMP9517); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: Multimodal, Standard
Summary: Computer vision is the interdisciplinary scientific field that develops theories and methods allowing computers to extract high-level information from digital images or videos. From an engineering perspective it seeks to automate perceptual tasks normally performed by the human visual system. Generally, vision is difficult because it is an inverse problem, where only insufficient information is available about the objects of interest in the image data. Physics-based mathematical and statistical models as well as machine-learning methods are used to assist in the task. Current real-world applications are wide-ranging, and include optical character recognition, machine inspection, retail object recognition, 3D model building, remote sensing, medical imaging, autonomous driving, motion capture, surveillance, face recognition, biometrics, and many others. This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts and an opportunity to develop a real-world application of computer vision.
Aims: The course aims to give students a broad understanding of both classical and modern computer vision theories and methods, as well as practical skills in implementing and developing computer vision algorithms and applications. In particular, the course will teach students about the formation process and characteristics of digital images, and the workings of techniques for image filtering and enhancement, feature extraction and representation, object detection and pattern recognition, image segmentation and classification, motion estimation and object tracking, and a wide range of applications. In addition to classical computer vision methods, students will also learn about modern machine learning and deep learning approaches for these tasks, and acquire practical skills in using them to solve real-world computer vision problems. As computer vision is a broad, interdisciplinary field with many possible applications, the course intends to lay the theoretical (computer science) as well as practical (computer engineering) foundation to address future computer vision challenges. Also, since solutions to big challenges typically require not only individual but also team efforts, the course includes both labs and a group project to help develop the necessary skills through practical experience complementing the knowledge acquired in the lectures.

Progressive Demo A 5% Retrospective A 2.5% Progressive Demo B 5% Retrospective B 2.5%
- Proposal (10%) – Group; Students identify, research, and analyse the problems given in an initial project description. They plan and specify a proposed solution to the identified problems, describe a product backlog of functionality to be delivered for the end product, as well as an initial sprint backlog to describe the functionality to be delivered in their first project iteration.
- Participation & Peer Assessment (20%) – Individual; Each student is required to complete short tasks to learn and demonstrate understanding of software engineering collaboration skills (10%). Additionally, students are evaluated based on their team's overall development workflow, consistent use of required technology, and their overall level of participation towards their team (10%). Each member’s contributions to the project are evaluated both by the group mentor and the other members of the group. A rubric determines how the member's participation is mapped into a mark.
- Final Project Deliverables (55%) – Group; This assessment includes: (1) a final presentation/demonstration of the completed software worth 20%, each team member is required to speak, marks and feedback are provided via a rubric attached to the final presentation feedback in the Learning Management System , (2) a report which documents the requirements, the progress, and strategies used during development, and the final product description worth 15%, marks and feedback are provided via a rubric attached to the report submission link in the Learning Management System , and (3) the project’s source code to assess the scale and technical depth, as well as the quality, completeness and correctness of the end product worth 20%, marks and feedback are awarded via a rubric attached to the source code submission link in the Learning Management System."

Research Project A (COMP9991); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: The course is for high achievers who can and want to maximise the kind of experience in research that a Masters by coursework can expose students to. It exceeds the aims of COMP9900 in doing more than ""putting everything together"": it aims at letting students tackle a genuine piece of research and improve on the state of the art, be it by making an algorithm more effective, or combining algorithms in new ways, or applying and adjusting particular techniques to new problems. Though projects can be purely theoretical, most projects will be applied at least to some extent and they will have an experimental component, thanks to which it is often possible to compare the proposed approach with existing ones. By the end of the term, students must give a seminar, inviting at least supervisor and assessor, with a presentation that is roughly 45 minutes long, during which they review the topic, including current approaches, plan for future work, and demonstrate they have made progress towards carrying out that plan. The presentation is followed by questions and answers, for a total of roughly an hour. A mark of less than 75 will not allow students to follow up with either COMP9992 or COMP9993; instead, they will have to enrol in COMP9900. A mark of at least 75 but less than 85 will allow students to enrol in COMP9992 but not in COMP9993; they will still have the option to instead enrol in COMP9900 if they wish. A mark of at least 85 will allow students to enrol in COMP9993; they will still have the option to instead enrol in COMP9900 or COMP9992 if they wish. Students will only be able to score at least 85 if the seminar has demonstrated that the work expected to successfully conduct the research is equivalent to completing 2 standard courses; if students eligible to enrol in COMP9993 prefer to enrol in COMP9992, the supervisor should first confirm that the project can be downsized so it becomes equivalent to completing 1 standard course; would that modification of the project not be possible, a student who is not keen to follow up with COMP9993 would have to enrol in COMP9900.
Aims: The course is for high achievers who can and want to maximise the exposure to research that a Masters by coursework has to expose students to. It exceeds the aims of COMP9900 in doing more than ""putting everything together"": it aims at letting students tackle a genuine piece of research and improve on the state of the art, be it by making an algorithm more effective, or combining algorithms in new ways, or applying and adjusting particular techniques to new problems. Though projects can be purely theoretical, most projects will be applied at least to some extent and they will have an experimental component, thanks to which it is often possible to compare the proposed approach with existing ones. By the end of the term, students must give a seminar, inviting at least supervisor and assessor, with a presentation that is roughly 30 minutes long, during which they review the topic, including current approaches, plan for future work, and demonstrate they have made some progress towards carrying out that plan. Whether COMP991 should be followed by COMP9992 or COMP9993, depending on how much work is expected to be needed to successfully conduct the research, is an important outcome of the seminar.

Assessments:
- Project Report (75%) – Individual; A research report should be uploaded to the Thesis Management System (TMS) in week 11, before Friday 6pm. TMS will invite supervisor and assessor to assess the research report, by awarding marks and providing comments using the following marking scheme, distributed over 3 criteria. • Literature review (25%) – FL (0-49%): Fails to review part of the literature that is directly relevant, or what is being reviewed is not always relevant. – PS (50-64%): A decent literature review though it might have a few gaps or it might not always be fully relevant. – CR (65-74%): A good literature review with no significant gap and that is always relevant. – DN (75-84%): A comprehensive literature review that identifies very well its limitation and where the problem fits. – HD (85-100%): A comprehensive literature review that demonstrates that the student has mastered the field and has an in-depth understanding of the state of art and where the research fits. • The tasks ahead (50%) – FL (0-49%): The problem is not well defined, there is no clear plan of what to do next. – PS (50-64%): The problem is reasonably well defined, there is a credible, achievable plan of what to do next . – CR (65-74%): The problem is well defined, there is a clear plan plan of what to do next, though everything remains to be done. – DN (75-84%): The problem is very well defined, there is a clear, solid plan plan of what to do next, and some preliminary work has been conducted along those lines. – HD (85-100%): The problem is very well defined, there is a clear, solid plan of what to do next, and significant work has been conducted already with conclusive outcomes. • Quality of presentation (25%) – FL (0-49%): Report is sloppy, poorly structured, almost always lacks clarity. – PS (50-64%): An acceptable report, that has been prepared carefully enough, reasonably well structured, reasonably clear. – CR (65-74%): A good report, carefully written, always clear with good illustrations, that reads easily. – DN (75-84%): A very good report, carefully designed and very well structured, with attention brought to details, always very clear in its explanations. – HD (85-100%): An excellent report, that provides true insights, professionally presented, thanks to a writing style that is always very effective. Supervisor and assessor will be aware that a total mark (seminar + report) of at least 75 is necessary for students to be allowed to follow up with COMP9992, and a total mark of at least 85 is necessary for students to be allowed to follow up with COMP9993. When the mark is at least 75 but less than 85, the supervisor will make sure that the project is possibly restricted so it is equivalent to completing 1 standard course. When the mark is at least 85, the supervisor will make sure that the same holds in case the student wishes to follow up with COMP9992, and also make sure that the project is possibly expanded so it is equivalent to completing 2 standard courses in case the student wishes to follow up with COMP9993.
- First Term Seminar (25%) – Individual; A seminar should be held in week 11, between Monday 9am and Friday 6pm, at a day and time that is suitable to all. The student should organise it, either online or physically depending on the circumstances and what is possible or best for everyone at the time. The seminar will be attended by at least the supervisor and the assessor. It is strongly advisable to advertise the seminar to the research students in the School (via email sent to research-students@cse.unsw.edu.au) to • give a chance to every PhD and Master by research student who is interested in the topic to find out more, • make sure that maximal feedback is received, • practice giving presentations to a larger audience. Supervisor and assessor will not only provide feedback on the progress and plan, but also determine which of COMP9992 or COMP9993 is most appropriate in the following term, taking into account student wishes and administrative constraints. An EC grading scheme is used. A mark is awarded at the end of COMP9992 or COMP9993 (provided that supervisor and assessor agree that student can enrol in one or the other in the following term), and includes assessment of work done in both terms, including a mark for COMP9991. Still, students who do not provide an adequate plan for the project by the end of term will NOT be allowed to continue to COMP9992 or COMP9993 and must repeat COMP9991. Also, the Thesis Management System (TMS) will invite supervisor and assessor to provide feedback on the seminar, by awarding marks whose value is indicative only, and by providing comments using the following marking scheme, distributed over 3 criteria. • Problem definition and state of the art (50%) – FL (0-49%): The problem being tackled is ill-defined. – PS (50-64%): The problem being tackled is well-defined but there is not enough knowledge or understanding of the techniques available to solve it, of their strengths and limitations. – CR (65-74%): Good understanding of the problem and the gap in the state of the art that would be filled by addressing the problem successfully. – DN (75-84%): Very good understanding of the problem, very good knowledge of the relevant literature. – HD (85-100%): Excellent understanding of the problem and an in-depth knowledge of where and why the best techniques known so far are limited. • Achievements so far (30%) – FL (0-49%): Nothing has been done besides studying the literature. – PS (50-64%): Some preliminary results, possibly experimental but not necessarily, have been obtained thanks to which the problem is better understood. – CR (65-74%): Some preliminary results, possibly experimental but not necessarily, represent the first steps towards a solution. – DN (75-84%): Substantial results have been obtained that offer a partial solution to the problem. – HD (85-100%): Thanks to the results that have been obtained, part of the problem can be considered as being fully solved. • Plan for COMP9992 or COMP9993 (20%) – FL (0-49%): Not much more clarity on how to approach the problem than when the project started. – PS (50-64%): Understanding of how to approach the problem and with a high probability, obtain good results. – CR (65-74%): Clear understanding of how to approach the problem in a structured manner and which milestones to aim for. – DN (75-84%): Very good understanding of the work ahead, of the chances of success of the planned approaches, and of the outcomes that can reasonably be expected. – HD (85-100%): Excellent proposal to structure the work ahead, with an in-depth appreciation of the chances of success of the various parts of the proposed work, with different paths to follow or not depending on progress to maximise the final achievements. These marks are only provided as feedback, they are not “official”, they won’t appear on your transcript, they won’t be used in the computation of the mark that is eventually awarded to COMP9991. That computation will be performed when completing COMP9992 or COMP9993, with a mark awarded to COMP9992 or COMP9993 and (retrospectively) to COMP9991 as well."
COMP9992,UNSW,https://www.unsw.edu.au/course-outlines/course-outline#year=2025&term=Term%203&deliveryMode=In%20Person&deliveryFormat=Standard&teachingPeriod=T3&deliveryLocation=Kensington&courseCode=COMP9992&activityGroupId=1,"General Course Information:
Research Project B (COMP9992); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: Students who have completed COMP9991 in their penultimate term of study in MIT (8543) and achieved a mark of at least 75 have the option to, in their last term of study, complete COMP9992. Unless they scored at least 85 in COMP9991, they do not have the option to select COMP9993. Also, rather than following up with COMP9992, they can instead enrol in COMP9990, would they wish so, or would they have to in case they scored less than 75 in COMP9991. The supervisor will make sure that the project is possibly restricted so it is equivalent to completing 1 standard course, in particular in the case of a student who is eligible to enrol in COMP9993 but who prefers to follow up with COMP9992. COMP9992 is expected to require a workload that is roughly equivalent to that of one standard course, but a research project being more open ended and tackled by very motivated students, it might turn out to be more time consuming. Meeting the expectations of COMP9991 + COMP9992, or even better, exceeding them with a piece of work that can result in a conference or journal publication, can make applications for a research degree stronger. COMP9991 has also been appealing to students who wanted to modestly improve on the state of the art in a particular discipline and be exposed to the various aspects of conducting research, working on a specific problem; COMP9992 completes that journey.
Aims: COMP9991 + COMP9992 is for high achievers who can and want to maximise the kind of experience in research that a Masters by coursework can expose students to. It exceeds the aims of COMP9900 in doing more than ""putting everything together"": it aims at letting students tackle a genuine piece of research and improve on the state of the art, be it by making an algorithm more effective, or combining algorithms in new ways, or applying and adjusting particular techniques to new problems. Though projects can be purely theoretical, most projects will be applied at least to some extent and they will have an experimental component, thanks to which it is often possible to compare the proposed approach with existing ones. By the end of the term, students must give a seminar, inviting at least supervisor and assessor, with a presentation that is roughly 45 minutes long, and submit a final report, that goes over all aspects of the work completed in both COMP9991 and COMP9992. Both seminar and report should demonstrate that the plan exposed in the COMP9991 seminar has been successfully completed. The main aim is to provide evidence that the student has acquired the skills that are necessary to successfully conduct a piece of research, in all aspects of the work, from producing a literature review to comparing one's results with those of other researchers, having brought some kind of innovation to the field.

Assessments:
- Seminar (25%) – Individual; Plan for a one hour seminar, with between half an hour and 45 mns devoted to your presentation or software demonstration, and the rest of time left to answer questions. For a practical project, the seminar is absolutely essential for demonstration purposes. Prepare carefully how you will present the features of your system, and be ready for using it as requested by the supervisor and assessor. For a theoretical project, you will want to explain the key ideas, without going over all the details that have been included in the report; whereas the report should demonstrate your ability to work at a low level of detail, the seminar should demonstrate that you can show “the big picture”. For all kinds of projects, the seminar gives the supervisor and assessor a chance to ask questions on the report. TMS will invite supervisor and assessor to assess the seminar, by awarding marks and providing comments using the following marking scheme, distributed over 2 criteria. • Project outcomes (70%) – FL (0-49%): Most of the work that was planned for COMP9992 as presented during the COMP9991 seminar failed to be completed. – PS (50-64%): Most of the work that was planned for COMP9992 as presented during the COMP9991 seminar has indeed been successfully completed, though some significant goals have not been reached. – CR (65-74%): Almost all of the work that was planned for COMP9992 as presented during the COMP9991 seminar has indeed been successfully completed, except for a few minor goals. – DN (75-84%): All the work that was planned for COMP9992 as presented during the COMP9991 seminar has indeed been fully completed, the project is successful. – HD (85-100%): All of the work and beyond that was planned for COMP9992 as presented during the COMP9991 seminar has indeed been fully completed, the results of the project are, be it modestly, beyond expectations. • Quality of presentation (30%) – FL (0-49%): Sloppy presentation. – PS (50-64%): Presentation has been well prepared and is reasonably clear and well structured. – CR (65-74%): Presentation has been very well prepared; provided that it has the assumed background, the audience follows it easily. – DN (75-84%): Presentation has been polished, it is very well structured, with good and insightful examples and illustrations. – HD (85-100%): Remarkable presentation, the student demonstrates that he or she was determined to be as pedagogical as possible, with a sense of perfectionism, and he or she fully succeeded.
- Final Report (75%) – Individual; A research report should be uploaded to the Thesis Management System (TMS) in week 11, before Friday 6pm.

ELEC5619,USYD,https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ELEC5619/2025-S2C-ND-CC,"Overview:

This unit aims to introduce students to the main issues involved in producing large Internet systems by using and building application frameworks. Frameworks allow great reuse so developers do not have to design and implement applications from scratch, as students have done in ELEC3610 The unit lays down the basic concepts and hands on experience on the design and development of enterprise systems, emphasizing the development of systems using design patterns and application frameworks. A project-based approach will introduce the problems often found when building such systems, and will require students to take control of their learning. A project-based approach will introduce the problems often found when building such systems, and will require students to take control of their learning. Several development Java frameworks will be used, including Spring, Hibernate, and others. Principles of design patterns will also be studied.

ELEC5620,USYD,https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ELEC5620/2025-S2C-ND-CC,"Overview:

Model-Based Software Engineering focuses on modern software engineering methods, technologies, and processes used in professional development projects. It covers both the pragmatic engineering elements and the underlying theory of the model-based approach to the analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance of complex software-intensive systems. Students will participate in a group project, which will entail developing and/or evolving a software system, following a full development cycle from requirements specification through to implementation and testing using up-to-date industrial development tools and processes. At the end of the course they will provide a presentation and demonstration of their project work to the class. There is no formal teaching of a programming language in this unit, although students will be expected to demonstrate through their project work their general software engineering and architectural skills as well as their mastery of model-based methods and technologies. Students successfully completing this unit will have a strong practical and theoretical understanding of the modern software development cycle as applied in industrial settings. In particular, they will be familiar with the latest model-based software engineering approaches necessary for successfully dealing with today's highly complex and challenging software systems. The pedagogic grounds for this course and its focus on model-based approaches are to arm new software engineers with skills and perspectives that extend beyond the level of basic programming. Such skills are essential to success in software development nowadays, and are in great demand but very low supply. The dearth of such expertise is one of the key reasons behind the alarmingly high failure rate of industrial software projects (currently estimated at being greater than 40%). Therefore, this unit complements SQE and strengthens a key area in the program.

MATH1064,USYD,https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/MATH1064/2025-S2C-ND-CC,"Overview:

This unit introduces students to the language and key methods of the area of Discrete Mathematics. The focus is on mathematical concepts in discrete mathematics and their applications, with an emphasis on computation. For instance, to specify a computational problem precisely one needs to give an abstract formulation using mathematical objects such as sets, functions, relations, orders, and sequences. In order to prove that a proposed solution is correct, one needs to apply the principles of mathematical logic, and to use proof techniques such as induction. To reason about the efficiency of an algorithm, one often needs to estimate the growth of functions or count the size of complex mathematical objects. This unit provides the necessary mathematical background for such applications of discrete mathematics. Students will be introduced to mathematical logic and proof techniques; sets, functions, relations, orders, and sequences; counting and discrete probability; asymptotic growth; and basic graph theory.

Assessment:

Assessment summary:
- Assignments: There are two short release assignments. Your work for each assignment must be submitted electronically via Canvas by the deadline. Note that your submission will not be marked if it is illegible or if it is submitted sideways or upside down. It is your responsibility to check that your assignment has been submitted correctly and that it is complete (check that you can view each page). Late submissions will receive a penalty. A mark of zero will be awarded for all submissions more than 10 days past the original due date. Further extensions past this time will not be permitted. The maximum extension you can be awarded through Special Consideration for the assignments is 7 calendar days. If you are affected for more than 7 calendar days you will be granted a mark adjustment. This means that your final exam mark will count instead for the assignment mark. The closing date for submissions (with a late penalty) is the same for all students. It is not changed if you are granted an extension. This allows for timely release of the marks and feedback. Note that the assignments are not eligible for a Simple Extension through the Special Consideration system since they are short release assignments (released to you to complete within 10 working days).
- Quiz: One quiz will be held in-person on campus during Week 8. You must sit the quiz at the time and location that appears as Assessment on your timetable. If you are unable to sit the quiz at that time for a valid reason, then you have the option to apply for Special Consideration or Special Arrangements. The better mark principle will be used for the quiz so the only reason to apply for Special Consideration or Special Arrangements is if you want to apply for a replacement quiz. The better mark principle means that the quiz counts if and only if it is better than or equal to your exam mark. If your quiz mark is less than your exam mark, the exam mark will be used for that portion of your assessment instead. Quiz feedback will be returned through Canvas.
- Weekly Online Quizzes: There are ten (equally weighted) weekly online quizzes. The first two quizzes are used for the Early Feedback Task . Each online quiz consists of a set of randomized questions. You should not apply for special consideration for the quizzes. The better mark principle will apply for the total 8% - i.e. if your overall exam mark is higher, then your 8% for the weekly online quizzes will come from your exam.

Data and Machine Learning (MATH5836); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: A wide range of statistical methods and computational tools have been developed in the past few decades to gather information from data. This postgraduate course covers the key techniques in data mining and machine learning with theoretical background and applications, delivered through a series of lectures and tutorials.The topics include methods such as linear and logistic regression, neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, clustering and dimensionality reduction, ensemble learning, and an introduction to deep learning. Emerging machine learning tools and libraries are used to illustrate the methods in programming environments that include Python and R.
Aims: This postgraduate course is expected to give students an understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning and the basics of data mining, which is essential for anyone contemplating a career as a professional statistician or data analyst in industries reliant upon such expertise. The student should develop a working knowledge of the statistical and theoretical underpinnings of the topics covered. Given this fundamental statistical understanding of these methodologies, this will allow the student to utilise these techniques with confidence on real-world data sets and scenarios. As such the student is expected to develop an applied working knowledge of the methodologies covered, largely through practical applications. In addition, students will undertake additional reading of a collection of associated research papers on each topic, to further add context to the methodologies presented during the course. This will enhance the student’s ability to utilise these techniques to solve real-world problems. It is stressed that this course is aimed at fundamental statistical properties of these methods, it is not a course on the application of computer software.

Bayesian Inference and Computation (MATH5960); 6 Units of Credit – Term 3 – Kensington – Delivery: In Person, Standard
Summary: After describing the fundamentals of Bayesian inference, this course will examine the specification of prior and posterior distributions, Bayesian decision theoretic concepts, the ideas behind Bayesian hypothesis tests, model choice and model averaging, and evaluate the capabilities of several common model types, such as hierarchical and mixture models. An important part of Bayesian inference is the requirement to numerically evaluate complex integrals on a routine basis. Accordingly this course will also introduce the ideas behind Monte Carlo integration, importance sampling, rejection sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers such as the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and use of the Stan posterior simulation software. The intended audience of this course is wide-ranging, from statistics and data science students to economics, actuarial, computer science and natural science (e.g. biology, geology, physics) students. Prior knowledge of basic probability is necessary, and knowledge of stochastic processes will be advantageous but is not required. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to Bayesian statistical concepts not seen in core courses which are primarily focused on frequentist statistics. This course is jointly taught at two levels. MATH3871 is for 3rd year undergraduates, whereas MATH5960 is for Honours & Masters students. Lectures will be conducted simultaneously for both streams, but tutorial classes and computer labs will be conducted separately for the two groups and assessments may differ The lectures run from Weeks 1 to 10, and the combined tutorial/lab sessions run after the weekly lectures (Weeks 2 to 10). Students should bring their laptops to the tutorials so that they can complete the coding exercises.
Aims: This course aims to: Provide a strong background in the concepts and philosophy of Bayesian inference; Instill an appreciation of the benefits of the Bayesian framework; Provide extensive practical opportunities to implement Bayesian data analyses; Present an overview of research activity in this field.

Assessment:

Assessment summary:
- Mastering Physics: Mastering Physics assignments are online tasks, due every two weeks. These are done using the MasteringPhysics system, accessed via Canvas. Each assignment consists of 6 questions, each worth 5 marks even though some are a little longer than others. They are a mix of tutorial-style questions teaching you concepts and problem-solving techniques, and end-of-chapter problems from the textbook. You can come back to the assignment as often as you like until the due date. MasteringPhysics marks the assignments automatically and you immediately know your result. The best 5 marks count towards your grade.
- Workshop tutorials: Contributing to Workshop Tutorials is an important part of success in this Unit of Study. Your mark is based on the number of tutorials attended. You can count attendance at some ""Physics Connect"" sessions towards your tutorial attendance.
- Tutorial discussion: Twice per semester you will demonstrate your ability to solve a tutorial problem to a tutor. Failure to complete two discussions will result in an AF grade.
- Laboratory work: circuits: Your laboratory work consists of circuits experiments, followed by a group project, which is the basis for your lab report. Assessment in the lab is based on completing competency checks. In order to pass the lab, you must achieve all listed competencies -- see Canvas for details.
- Mid-semester test: The mid-semester test will cover material from the first lecture module (Electricity and Magnetism). The test is made up of short-answer questions. It will be held during your scheduled lab session.
- Final examination: The final exam is on material not tested in the mid-semester test. No laboratory work is examinable. The final exam is a compulsory assessment task. Failure to sit the final exam will result in an AF grade.
- Lab test: This is a practical and written test on circuits.
- Lab report: At the end of semester you will submit a lab report based on the group research project.
